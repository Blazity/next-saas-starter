## Case

I wanted to reduce Vercel's bandwidth usage by serving images directly from CMS. But there were also a few requirements:

- sticking to the original **_next/image_** implementation
- serving assets in **_.webp_** whenever it's possible with a fallback to .jpeg format
- make it as self-manageable as possible

I am using Contentful Images API here as an example, but I bet your CMS uses something similar! (Most of them use [Filestack](https://www.filestack.com/) under the hood)

## Problem

In next.js, there's no official way to check whether the browser supports webp format or not while using custom image loader feature. This could be fixed through a custom server, but Vercel does not support this.[^2]

## Solutions

### Using Next.js redirects

If you're using a recent Next.js version (greater than v10.2.0), this might be a great solution. It adds a little overhead to each request, but it is hard to make them stack up to a degree that causes problems.

<Code
  code={`# next.config.js 
module.exports = { 
  async redirects() {
    return [
      {
        /* If accept header contains image/webp string, serve webp image */
        source: "/cdn-images/:path*",
        has: [
          {
            type: "header",
            key: "Accept",
            value: "(?<bogus>.*.image/webp.*)",
          },
        ],
        /* 
        Question mark is not a query params initializer.
        It is a marker for optional param from path-to-regexp library.
        */
        destination: "https://images.ctfassets.net/:path*?fm=webp",
        permanent: true,
      },
      {
        /* If accept header does not contain image/webp string, serve jpg image */
        source: "/cdn-images/:path*",
        has: [
          {
            type: "header",
            key: "Accept",
            value: "(?<bogus>.*.(?!image/webp).*)",
          },
        ],
        destination: "https://images.ctfassets.net/:path*?fm=jpg",
        permanent: true,
      }
    ]
  }
}`}
/>

<Code
  code={`const COMPATIBLE_WIDTHS = [320, 375, 425, 550, 640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200]; 
const CONTENTFUL_IMAGES_API_URL = "images.ctfassets.net";  
  
const customLoader = ({ src, width, quality }: ImageLoaderProps) => {
  const isSizeSupported = COMPATIBLE_WIDTHS.includes(width);
  const isContentfulHosted = src.includes(CONTENTFUL_IMAGES_API_URL);
    
  if (isSizeSupported && isContentfulHosted) {
    const url = new URL(src);  
    const srcWithoutHost = url.pathname; 
    // Do not delete that \`&\` at the end, it is required to make it work with path-to-regexp library  
    return \`/cdn-images\${srcWithoutHost}?w=\${width}&q=\${quality || 75}&\`;  
  };  
  
  return src;
};
  
  
<Image loader={customLoader} {...imageProps} />`}
  language="jsx"
/>

**Pros:**

- Serverless (and so, easy to scale)
- No need to maintain in any way
- 99.99% Uptime guaranteed
- Easy and quick to use (but coding this wasn't fun!)
- Server-side solution, so it will work with JavaScript disabled
- Works everywhere

**Cons:**

- Won't work on older Next.js versions (greater than v10.2.0 required)
- Extremely hacky Regex-like syntax [path-to-regexp](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp)
- Increases network overhead (redirects). In my case, it adds a minor 30-60ms delay to each request

### Client-side solution

This one should work in theory, but I have never tested it myself. I like keeping important libraries up-to-date, and this solution makes it a little bit harder, so I had to pass on it. You could use this script to check if your browser supports webp images, and assign its result to a global variable. Then, based on its value replace the src attribute with the appropriate format's extension[^1].

<Code
  code={`// check_webp_feature:
//   'feature' can be one of 'lossy', 'lossless', 'alpha' or 'animation'.
//   'callback(feature, result)' will be passed back the detection result (in an asynchronous way!)
function check_webp_feature(feature, callback) {
    var kTestImages = {
        lossy: "UklGRiIAAABXRUJQVlA4IBYAAAAwAQCdASoBAAEADsD+JaQAA3AAAAAA",
        lossless: "UklGRhoAAABXRUJQVlA4TA0AAAAvAAAAEAcQERGIiP4HAA==",
        alpha: "UklGRkoAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAQUxQSAwAAAARBxAR/Q9ERP8DAABWUDggGAAAABQBAJ0BKgEAAQAAAP4AAA3AAP7mtQAAAA==",
        animation: "UklGRlIAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAASAAAAAAAAAAAAQU5JTQYAAAD/////AABBTk1GJgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGQAAABWUDhMDQAAAC8AAAAQBxAREYiI/gcA"
    };
    var img = new Image();
    img.onload = function () {
        var result = (img.width > 0) && (img.height > 0);
        callback(feature, result);
    };
    img.onerror = function () {
        callback(feature, false);
    };
    img.src = "data:image/webp;base64," + kTestImages[feature];
}`}

Keep in mind that the script needs to be blocking (takes ~1ms so don't worry) and loaded before any next.js chunk. To preserve these changes on every install you can use [patch-package](https://github.com/ds300/patch-package#readme).

**Pros:**

- 99.99% Uptime guaranteed

- No network overhead at all

- No scalability issues

- No maintenance's needed

**Cons:**

- Client-side only, but it won't affect anything important (like SEO)

- Patching next.js (makes it harder to update)

- Might not work in sketchy browsers

### Using a proxy

You could use existing products like Nginx or even code a custom one. The idea stays the same, redirect to a correct format based on Accept header. But numerous cons make this (at least) not an ideal solution.

**Pros:**

- Quick & easy to setup

**Cons:**

- Not quick & not so easy to maintain
- Not serverless
- You might encounter scalability issues in big-scale projects
- Increase in network overhead
- Images are not served directly from CMS so you would have to pay more
